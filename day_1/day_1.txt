Getting Started with Microsoft SQL Server

Today, I began my Data Engineering documentation journey.
I installed Microsoft SQL Server along with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for interacting with the database using a graphical interface.

After setup, I practiced some basic SQL operations to get familiar with querying data. Here's what I covered:

SELECT: Used to retrieve data from a table.

FROM: Specifies the table to fetch the data from.

WHERE: Filters records based on specific conditions.

ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns (ascending or descending).
