Data Categorization and Formatting Using CASE Statements

Today, I focused on mastering the use of the CASE expression in SQL â€” a powerful tool for conditional logic, data labeling, and cleanup during query execution.

ðŸ“Š Key Exercises and Concepts:

Sales Categorization:

Generated a sales report that categorized orders into:

'Higher' for sales > 50

'Medium' for sales between 21 and 50

'Low' for sales â‰¤ 20

Sorted the results from lowest to highest sales.

Gender Formatting in Employee Data:

Converted single-letter gender codes ('M', 'F') into full text ('Male', 'Female') using CASE.

Country Code Abbreviation:

Mapped country names to short codes (e.g., 'Germany' â†’ 'DE', 'USA' â†’ 'US') and used 'n/a' for others.

Handling NULL Scores in Customer Data:

Replaced NULL scores with 0 using CASE to ensure clean numeric output.

Selected essential fields like CustomerID and LastName for context.

ðŸ§  Takeaways:

CASE is incredibly useful for dynamic labeling and data transformation directly within SQL queries.

It's perfect for:

Replacing or translating values

Handling NULLs gracefully

Creating readable output for reports

Using CASE helps simplify downstream processing by applying logic inside the database layer.
