String Functions & Data Cleaning in SQL

Today I focused on exploring string manipulation functions in SQL. These are especially useful for cleaning and formatting text data, which is a common task in real-world data pipelines.

ðŸ§¹ String Operations Practiced:

CONCAT(): Combined customer first name and country into one formatted column.

LOWER() / UPPER(): Converted first names to lowercase and uppercase.

TRIM() with LEN():

Identified customers whose names have leading or trailing spaces.

Measured the length of first_name values to verify data quality.

REPLACE(): Replaced dashes - with slashes / in phone numbers â€” a helpful technique for cleaning contact details.

LEFT() / RIGHT(): Extracted the first two characters from both sides of the first_name.

SUBSTRING(): Removed the first character from the first_name, extracting everything after it.

ðŸ“˜ Key Takeaways:

String functions like TRIM, REPLACE, and SUBSTRING are essential for cleaning inconsistent or messy data.

These functions can be easily chained or combined in complex transformations.

Practicing such operations helps prepare for common data engineering tasks, especially in preprocessing stages.

It was satisfying to work on textual data todayâ€”it gave me a better sense of how SQL handles character-based operations.
