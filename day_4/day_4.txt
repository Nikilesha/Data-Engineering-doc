Filtering Data and Working with SQL Joins

Today I focused on retrieving and filtering data using various SQL clauses and explored different types of joins to connect multiple tables. It was a great practice session that helped me deepen my understanding of both simple and advanced queries.

ðŸ”Ž Data Filtering & Pattern Matching:

Used WHERE with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to filter customers based on country and score.

Used BETWEEN to retrieve scores in a specific range.

Practiced IN to match against multiple values.

Applied the LIKE operator for pattern matching:

Names starting with 'M'

Names ending with 'n'

Names with 'r' in the third position

ðŸ”— SQL Joins:

INNER JOIN: Retrieved customers who have placed orders (matched by ID).

LEFT JOIN: Retrieved all customers, including those with no orders.

RIGHT JOIN: Retrieved all orders, including those without matching customers.

FULL JOIN: Retrieved all customers and orders, including unmatched rows from both.

LEFT JOIN with NULL filter: Found customers who havenâ€™t placed any orders.

ðŸ“˜ Key Learnings:

The difference between INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins.

How to filter results post-join (e.g., customers with no orders using WHERE o.customer_id IS NULL).

Mastered how to query and filter data in more dynamic ways using string patterns and logical conditions.

This day really helped tie together filtering logic and relational database concepts like joins. Looking forward to digging into aggregations and group functions next!
