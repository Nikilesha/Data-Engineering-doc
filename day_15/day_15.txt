Day 15 â€“ 12/07/2025
Light Day, but Kept the Streak Alive

Today was a relatively light day in terms of new learning, but I made sure to keep up the habit and reinforce concepts from previous sessions.

ðŸ“Œ What I Practiced:

Used window functions like SUM() OVER() to calculate:

Total sales across all orders.

Total sales per product while still showing each OrderID and OrderDate.

This helped me better understand how window functions allow me to add aggregated insights without losing row-level details, which is great for dashboards and analysis.

ðŸ§  Reflection:

Even though I didnâ€™t dive into new topics, showing up and revisiting concepts helped me reinforce my learning. The important thing is â€” I didnâ€™t stop.

Looking forward to a deeper dive tomorrow!
