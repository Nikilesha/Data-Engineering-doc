Understanding SQL Statement Execution Order

Today I focused on understanding the order of execution in SQL queries. Initially, I found it a bit confusing, especially differentiating between the WHERE and HAVING clauses, but after some hands-on exercises, things started to click.

ðŸ“š Key Concepts Learned:

The general SQL execution order:

FROM

WHERE

GROUP BY

HAVING

SELECT

DISTINCT

ORDER BY

WHERE: Used to filter rows before grouping.

HAVING: Used to filter groups after aggregation.

ðŸ§  Learning Note:

I used to mix up WHERE and HAVING, but I realized that WHERE works on raw data, and HAVING works on grouped or aggregated data. Practice really helped solidify this.

âœ… Practice:

Ran multiple queries using GROUP BY, HAVING, and WHERE to compare their behavior.

Explored how DISTINCT works when used with multiple columns.

It was a fun and insightful dayâ€”understanding the execution order makes writing and debugging SQL much easier.
