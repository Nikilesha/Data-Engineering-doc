Practicing Table Operations and Data Manipulation

Today was all about getting hands-on with table structure and data manipulation in SQL. I practiced key commands related to creating, altering, and deleting tables, as well as inserting and updating records.

🧱 Table Operations:

CREATE TABLE: Defined a persons table with columns for ID, name, birth date, and phone number.

ALTER TABLE:

Added a new column: email

Dropped the phone column

DROP TABLE: Completely removed the persons table from the database.

📝 Data Manipulation:

INSERT INTO:

Added new records into the customers table.

Copied selected data from customers into persons using SELECT.

UPDATE: Modified the score and country for a customer with a specific id.

DELETE:

Deleted specific records where id > 5.

TRUNCATE: Cleared all data from the customers table while keeping the structure intact.

💡 Key Takeaways:

Learned how to modify table structure after creation using ALTER.

Practiced the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE.

Reinforced the use of INSERT INTO ... SELECT for copying data between tables.

Each command gave me a clearer understanding of how SQL interacts with both the structure and the data in a database.
