Mastering Comparative Analysis with Window Functions

Today was focused on using window functions to compare individual values against global and group-level aggregates. It deepened my understanding of ranking, filtering by aggregates, and advanced usage of COALESCE and subqueries.

üß† What I Learned & Practiced:

‚úÖ Average Score with Null Handling:

Used COALESCE(score, 0) to treat NULL scores as zero.

Calculated average score across all customers while preserving row-level details.

‚úÖ Sales Comparison Against Averages:

Identified orders where sales exceeded the average sales using a subquery with AVG() over all rows.

‚úÖ Min/Max Per Product:

Found the highest and lowest sales per product using MIN() and MAX() with PARTITION BY productID.

‚úÖ Global Maximum Salary:

Found employees with the highest salary using a windowed MAX() function and filtered with a subquery.

üîç Key Takeaways:

AVG() OVER() is extremely useful to benchmark each row against a global value.

Subqueries with window functions make it easy to filter based on calculated columns.

The COALESCE() function is handy to clean NULLs without losing context.

Performance insights become clearer when you mix aggregation with full-row context.
