Day 9 - 14/06/2025
Numeric and Date/Time Functions in SQL

Today was packed with learning essential numeric operations and date/time manipulation functions in SQL â€” a key part of reporting, analytics, and time-based filtering in data engineering.

ðŸ§® Numeric Functions:

ROUND(): Rounded a number to two decimal places.

ABS(): Returned the absolute value of a number.

These functions are useful for formatting results and cleaning calculations.

ðŸ“… Date & Time Functions:

Basic Retrieval:

Used GETDATE() to retrieve the current system date.

Retrieved and formatted fields like orderDate, shipDate, and creationTime.

Part Extraction:

Extracted day, month, and year using both:

DAY(), MONTH(), YEAR()

DATEPART() for more granular control (e.g., hour, minute, quarter, week)

DATENAME():

Returned string values for month, weekday, and year from creationTime.

Helpful when needing readable output for labels or reports.

DATETRUNC():

Truncated creationTime to the nearest minute or month for cleaner groupings.

EOMONTH():

Retrieved the last date of the month for any given datetime â€” useful for financial and monthly closing reports.

ðŸ“Š Practical Exercises:

Counted number of orders placed in each month using DATENAME() and GROUP BY.

Retrieved all orders that were placed in the month of February using MONTH(orderDate) = 2.

ðŸ§  Key Takeaways:

Date and time functions are crucial for building time-based insights and summaries.

SQL provides a rich set of tools to both manipulate and format date fields for analytical tasks.

Knowing the difference between functions like DATENAME, DATEPART, and DATETRUNC can help you produce both human-readable and precise outputs.

Another productive day filled with practical utility and core concepts that will come in handy for time series analysis and dashboards!
