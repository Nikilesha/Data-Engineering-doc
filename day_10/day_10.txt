Aggregations, Ranking, and Shipping Time Insights

Today, I practiced writing SQL queries involving aggregations, summaries, and time-based filtering to answer real-world business questions.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Concepts Covered:

Total Sales per Customer
Used SUM(sales) grouped by CustomerID to find how much each customer has contributed to the total revenue.

Top 5 Products by Quantity Sold
Applied TOP 5 along with SUM(quantity) and GROUP BY productID to identify the most sold products.

Monthly Sales Trends
Leveraged DATENAME(month, creationTime) to extract month names and grouped sales totals by month â€” a great way to visualize trends over time.

Most Active Customers (by Orders)
Identified customers who placed the highest number of orders by summing up quantity and grouping by CustomerID.

Shipping Duration Analysis
Used DATEDIFF(day, orderDate, shipDate) to calculate the shipping time and filtered to get orders that took more than 7 days to ship.

ðŸ§  Takeaways:

Aggregation functions like SUM() combined with GROUP BY are powerful tools for summarizing data at different levels.

Business-driven queries such as identifying top customers or shipping inefficiencies are very common in analytics workloads.

Using functions like DATEDIFF() allows you to translate raw dates into actionable insights (e.g., late shipments).

This session was very insightful and closer to the kind of reporting and analytical thinking required in real-world data engineering tasks.
