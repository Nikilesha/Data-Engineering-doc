Day 7 - 12/06/2025
Light Day but Kept the Momentum Going

Today was a relatively light day in terms of learning new concepts, but I made sure not to break the flow.

ðŸ”„ Task Completed:

Worked with archived and active order data stored in two separate tables: sales.Orders and sales.OrdersArchive.

Used the UNION operator to combine records without duplicates, creating a unified order report.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM sales.Orders
UNION
SELECT * FROM sales.OrdersArchive;
This helped reinforce how UNION works behind the scenes and showed the practical application of set operations in real-world databases.

ðŸ§  Reflection:

Even though I didnâ€™t explore a major new topic today, solving a problem on my own gave me confidence and reminded me that consistency matters more than intensity. Some progress is always better than none.
